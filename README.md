This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn Python and related tech skills.

## ðŸ“… â€“ July 14, 2025
Todayâ€™s accomplishments:

-Reviewed and practiced Python assertion statements to handle errors and input validation.
-Explored the purpose of assertions and where programmers typically use them in code.
-Clarified concepts around functions (def), built-in functions like print(), and how to write your own functions.
-Learned how to split long strings over multiple lines in Python for readability.
-Practiced working with f-strings for formatting output dynamically with variables.
-Created a small interactive text adventure game in Python featuring a cat named Freak:
-Used multi-line print() statements to tell a story.
-Collected user input with input() and converted it to lowercase for easier comparisons.
-Implemented a while True loop to validate user choices and keep prompting until valid input is given.
-Added conditional branching (if, elif, else) to handle different player decisions.
-Added a simple math riddle as a mini-game mechanic.
-Personalized responses using f-strings with the playerâ€™s name.
-Practiced handling unexpected user input gracefully.
-Learned the basics of GitHub file structure and how to write a README.md to describe projects.

Personal reflections:

At times, the debugging and assertions felt confusing and a bit frustrating â€” I wasnâ€™t sure why Iâ€™d want to create errors on purpose! But working through it helped me understand the value of catching problems early in the code.

Writing the interactive cat story game was a huge confidence boost. It was fun to combine what Iâ€™ve learned with a little creativity, and Iâ€™m proud that I wrote the whole thing by myself. Seeing how the input loop and conditional logic work together finally clicked for me.

Iâ€™m excited to keep building projects like this, and I feel more motivated now to tackle Python step-by-step without getting overwhelmed by the math or more advanced concepts.

Next steps:

Continue learning more advanced concepts, with regular review along the way.

Practice more input validation and error handling.

Learn how to organize multiple small projects within one GitHub repository.

**What I practiced today:**
- Removing items from a list with a `while` loop
- Using `.append()` and `.insert()` to build or modify lists
- Formatting list output using slicing and `.join()`
- Replacing items in lists using `for i in range(len(...))`
- Understanding how `i` is the index (starting at 0)
- Building fluency through repetition

ðŸ§  **Reflections:**  
I'm starting to get used to patterns like `for i in range(len(...))`. It's still abstract, but practice is helping. I also realized that GitHub and LinkedIn are useful tools to see where this learning can lead.

ðŸ’¡ **Next step:**  
More practice, one mini-project per day, and track it all here.
