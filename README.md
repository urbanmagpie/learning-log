This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn Python and related tech skills.

## ðŸ“… â€“ July 14, 2025

Todayâ€™s Accomplishments:

- Reviewed and practiced Python assertion statements.
- Explored where programmers typically use assertions.
- Clarified how to define functions and the difference from built-in functions like print().
- Practiced splitting long strings over multiple lines.
- Used f-strings to make printouts more dynamic.
- Wrote my first interactive story-based game in Python:
    - Used input() to interact with the player.
    - Added loops to keep asking until valid input.
    - Used conditionals (if/elif/else) to make choices meaningful.
    - Added simple math as a riddle to make the game more interactive.
    - Personalized the game using the playerâ€™s name.
- Practiced writing a clean README.md for my GitHub project.
- Learned where to put project descriptions in GitHub.

Next Steps:

- Keep practicing more advanced Python topics while reviewing older material.
- Upload projects to GitHub to track my progress.
- Write more fun mini-games to reinforce my learning.
- Stay consistent and have fun coding!


Personal reflections:

At times, the debugging and assertions felt confusing and a bit frustrating â€” I wasnâ€™t sure why Iâ€™d want to create errors on purpose! But working through it helped me understand the value of catching problems early in the code.

Writing the interactive cat story game was a huge confidence boost. It was fun to combine what Iâ€™ve learned with a little creativity, and Iâ€™m proud that I wrote the whole thing by myself. Seeing how the input loop and conditional logic work together finally clicked for me.

Iâ€™m excited to keep building projects like this, and I feel more motivated now to tackle Python step-by-step without getting overwhelmed by the math or more advanced concepts.

**What I practiced today:**
- Removing items from a list with a `while` loop
- Using `.append()` and `.insert()` to build or modify lists
- Formatting list output using slicing and `.join()`
- Replacing items in lists using `for i in range(len(...))`
- Understanding how `i` is the index (starting at 0)
- Building fluency through repetition

ðŸ§  **Reflections:**  
I'm starting to get used to patterns like `for i in range(len(...))`. It's still abstract, but practice is helping. I also realized that GitHub and LinkedIn are useful tools to see where this learning can lead.

ðŸ’¡ **Next step:**  
More practice, one mini-project per day, and track it all here.
