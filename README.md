This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn Python and related tech skills.

## ðŸ“… July 11, 2025

**What I practiced today:**
- Removing items from a list with a `while` loop
- Using `.append()` and `.insert()` to build or modify lists
- Formatting list output using slicing and `.join()`
- Replacing items in lists using `for i in range(len(...))`
- Understanding how `i` is the index (starting at 0)
- Building fluency through repetition

ðŸ§  **Reflections:**  
I'm starting to get used to patterns like `for i in range(len(...))`. It's still abstract, but practice is helping. I also realized that GitHub and LinkedIn are useful tools to see where this learning can lead.

ðŸ’¡ **Next step:**  
More practice, one mini-project per day, and track it all here.
